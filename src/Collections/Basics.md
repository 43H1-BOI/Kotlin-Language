- Group of Elements of same type or their subtypes

Array also do the same jon so ow are Collections and Arrays Different ??
Size of Array is Definite
Whereas Size of Collection varies as per data

// Adding new element requires removing other element
//      Whereas it is easy to add or remove elements in Collections without compromising data

    List is an ordered collection with access to elements by indices â€” integer numbers that
    reflect their position. Elements can occur more than once in a list. An example of a list is a
    telephone number: it's a group of digits, their order is important, and they can repeat.


    Set is a collection of unique elements. It reflects the mathematical abstraction of set: a
    group of objects without repetitions. Generally, the order of t elements has no
    significance. For example, the numbers on lottery tickets form a set: they are unique, and
    their order is not important.


    Map (or dictionary) is a set of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and each of them maps to
    exactly one value. The values can be duplicates. Maps are useful for storing logical
    connections between objects, for example, an employee's ID and their position.


## Types of Collection :-
- **Read-Only** 
- **Mutable**
